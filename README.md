# XamarinTestApp
Xamarin test app with no platform specific UI code, there is 100% code reuse between iOS, Android and WinPhone platforms.

Everything is going on in the TestApp project, inside .cs files. Everything is done with C#. Xamarin renders those instructions into platform-specific code and user experiences.

Installations folder contains an .apk file for Android phones. It is a small demonstration of native controls, and embedded websites.

iOS (and Windows Phone) version would look similar, but I don't have a PC with OS X, so sadly I can't compile the iOS version. But it _should_ look very similar to the Android version :)

This is based on tutorials from xamarin.com and sitepoint.com, and official documentation.
